I built a notes app from scratch using React and localStorage. The app has all the required functionalities, for example, storing a user input, saving it, and deleting it. I used localStorage to persist the data to the browser. Therefore, it is not lost when we refresh the page. I went a step further to add a character count so the user knows how much space they have left to type.
